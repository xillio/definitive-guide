# Xill Plugins: The Definitive Guide


Birds fly, matches burn, wind blows and content grows. There's little you can do about it. It seems like the longer we work with a certain system the faster its data starts to grow. This is all fine until we reach the point where the current system no longer fits our needs and it has to be replaced. This is where the complex migration projects start.

Back in 2010 Ernst van Rheenen started a mission to make these migration projects run as smooth and risk-free as possible. He did this by developing the first version of a scripting language that allows programmers to easily connect systems and perform various operations on their content. Later this prototype was shaped into a tool that was used by all Xillio's consultants to perform custom migrations. It was able to withstand the full force of the content thrown at it so that is when, in 2014, development started on the public third iteration of what we now know as *Xill*. This iteration is presented to everyone who is interested as an open source project.

Xill is not about providing a standard boxed solution for every content related project out there. It is about providing a platform for content consultants and Java developers to work together to create a modular, resilient, easy and powerful scripting language that can be used to realize projects with large amounts of content with a little risk as possible.

## Who Should Read This Guide

This guide is for anyone who wishes to extend the functionality of Xill from the Java point of view. It will help you get started on your project to develop a plugin for Xill as well as provide some solutions for more advanced problems down the line.

This guide is suitable for starting Java developers and Java seniors alike. We expect you to have a programming background but transitioning from any other language should not be impossible. Even though we will not be discussing the basic of Java software development it should be possible to understand most of the code examples in this guide for any programmer.

## Why Did We Write This Guide

After the development of the Xill core stabilized we started building plugins there was no tomorrow. Soon it became clear that this would be something any java developer could do and maybe even like, so we set out to simplify xill plugin development as much as we reasonably could and decided to document in detail how to build these plugins. To do this we took the initiative to start writing a comprehensive guide that would not only be a simple reference for beginning developers but also provide some reasonable background to the decisions you would have to make when creating your own plugin.

The reason we choose for this format is because we can publish it to several platforms so anyone could always have a copy of the guide available to them.
